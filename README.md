# Manhunt mod for Fabric, completely server-sided

### Aka Manhunt Intermediately Lightweight Fabric Server

I'm surprised this compiles to begin with

It almost completely works somehow as well

It doesn't completely work with 2+ runners

And I haven't tested with 2+ hunters either so don't expect this to work
